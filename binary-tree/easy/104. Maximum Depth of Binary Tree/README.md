# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return its **maximum depth**.

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Examples

### Example 1
![tmp-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9078e628-554a-4633-b793-4251510859f7)

**Input**:
```
root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

**Output**:
```
3
```
### Example 2

**Input**:
```
root = [1,null,2]
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
