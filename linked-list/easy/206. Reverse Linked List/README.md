# 206. Reverse Linked List

**Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Example 1:
![rev1ex1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e0aefb7-ff32-4792-988d-2ccc3ac0717c)

**Input**: 
```
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
```
**Output**: 
```
[5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Example 2:
![rev1ex2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa2cf29e-66a6-4cfc-ae65-fdccc6e9940a)

**Input**: 
```
head = [1,2]
```
**Output**: 
```
[2,1]
```

### Example 3:

**Input**: 
```
head = []
```
**Output**: 
```
[]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

### Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
