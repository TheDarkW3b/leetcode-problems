**Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/)

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

### Example 1:
![lc-midlist1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a932b80d-4a5b-4e67-9a1e-c474c59a7464)

**Input**: head = [1,2,3,4,5]  
**Output**: [3,4,5]  
**Explanation**: The middle node of the list is node 3.

### Example 2:
![lc-midlist2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c25eab9f-19e8-420f-8414-a57655c3d2b4)

**Input**: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
**Output**: [4,5,6]  
**Explanation**: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
